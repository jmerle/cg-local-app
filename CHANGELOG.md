# 1.1.0 - October 6th, 2018
- Removed the FXLauncher dependency, which previously handled the auto-updating. Since the application is considered stable, this is no longer necessary. By removing FXLauncher, I am not required to keep up a webhost to host the files on, and the application will launch faster because it doesn't have to do an up-to-date check.
